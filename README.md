# tech-blog

## Description 

This is a full stack tech blog. The back-end is a MySQL database, using Express.js to run node packages. Sequelize is used to read and write to the database. Express-session and connect-session-sequelize NPM packages manage the user's session using cookies and store them to the schema. Bcrypt is a NPM package that hashes out sensitive information, such as the user's raw password or email, and turns it into a encrypted passphrase that can be used to verify login credentials. Front-end HTML and CSS is generated for the user with the Handlebars NPM package. Dotenv omits sensitive server information and all node modules and other unnecessary files from being pushed up to GitHub.
